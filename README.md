# snake_rust_macroquad
building a snake game to learn more about rust using the macroquad library, and farming some greens to satisfy myself and feel like a real programmer

## Control the snake

| `j`  | move snake down       |
| `k`  | move snake Up         |
| `h`  | move snake right      |
| `l`  | move snake left       |

> [!note] why not arrow keys ?
> the answer is.. i like using vim motion, i don't really care if you don't like it...
